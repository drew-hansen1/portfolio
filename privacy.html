    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>December 8, 2025</strong></p>
  <section>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Automatic analytics data:</strong> We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> (a service provided by Google LLC) to collect information about how visitors use the website. Google Analytics may collect device and usage information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address (may be anonymized by Google)</li>

    </ul>
    <p>This information is collected automatically through cookies and similar technologies and is used for site analytics and to help us improve the website.</p>

    <p><strong>No other automatic data collection:</strong> Other than Google Analytics, we do not use third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertising networks on this site.</p>

    <p><strong>Voluntarily provided information:</strong> The website does not require you to create an account. If you voluntarily contact us (for example via an email address or a contact form), we will collect the contact information you provide (such as your name and email address) and any content of your message. That information is used only to respond to you and will not be shared except as required by law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The site uses Google Analytics, a third-party analytics provider. Google may process information in accordance with its own privacy policy and terms. We recommend reviewing Google's privacy documentation to understand how they handle data.</p>

Contact messages and voluntarily provided information are retained only as long as necessary to respond and as required by law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect information we collect. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of information.</p>
